# ‚òÑÔ∏è Asteroid Alerting Service

## üìñ Description

The **Asteroid Alerting Service** is a microservices-based application that monitors near-earth asteroids and alerts users to potentially hazardous objects.  
It fetches data from NASA's **Near Earth Object (NEO)** API, filters for asteroids that could pose a threat, and sends email notifications to registered users.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Asteroid Tracking** ‚Äî Ingests up-to-date information from NASA's NEO API.
- **Threat Assessment** ‚Äî Filters asteroids based on size, velocity, and proximity to Earth.
- **Scalable Messaging** ‚Äî Uses **Apache Kafka** as a message queue to decouple services and ensure reliable communication.
- **Email Notifications** ‚Äî Sends alerts to registered users via email.
- **Persistent Notifications** ‚Äî Stores a record of all notifications sent.

The service is composed of **two primary microservices**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Asteroid Alert Module
- Periodically polls the NASA NEO API for new asteroid data.
- Parses the data and identifies potentially hazardous asteroids.
- Publishes a message to a **Kafka topic** for each hazardous asteroid.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Service
- Consumes messages from the Kafka topic.
- Stores notification details in a **MySQL** database.
- Looks up subscribed users.
- Sends a formatted **email alert** to each recipient.
